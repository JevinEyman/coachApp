                    <p class="flow-text">Distance running is in Erica’s blood.  Her dad was a successful marathoner, winning the Smoky Mountain Marathon in 1982.  Erica followed her passion and began running in high school and then was able to continue collegiately at the University of Central Florida, where she was part of the Conference USA Championship winning team for the first time in school history.  Erica continued to run after college, shifting from the 5000m to longer distance events. In time, Erica established herself as one of the top female runners in the state of Florida.</p>

                    <p class="flow-text">Erica ran her first marathon one year after college and ended up with a second place finish and respectable time of 3:05. She has competed in 3 Boston Marathons (2012-2014) with a PR of 2:56. Erica realized at the end of 2014 that she wanted to be more competitive and began training for the marathon with consistent training and coaching.  Erica smashed her PR by almost 9 minutes with a 2:47 at the Grandma's Marathon in June 2015. She then went on to become the 2017 Napa Valley Marathon champion, running 2:48:48 on a cold and blustery day.</p>
                    
                    <p class="flow-text">Erica competed in the elite field of the Peachtree 10k in Atlanta and ran her fastest time ever at the event despite training through that race while focusing on the 2017 Chicago Marathon. At the 2017 Chicago Marathon, she ran a 2:45:24 which was 2 minutes and 34 seconds faster than her previous personal record.  Erica’s ultimate goal is to qualify for the 2020 US Olympic Trials in the marathon.</p>

            <div class="card-panel">
              <p class="flow-text">Erica worked in the corporate world for 3 years in Retail Management and Recruiting until she realized something was missing. She decided to follow her true passion for the sport of running and become a coach as well as an athletes.
              <p class="flow-text">Erica began as an Assistant Coach for the Winter Park Wildcats, where she motivated and trained with the athletes who went on to become some of the top contenders for the state of Florida. Erica brought that experience to her first Head Coach position at Lake Howell High School, also located in Winter Park, Florida, where she was in charge of the Boys and Girls Cross Country and Track and Field teams. She brought several athletes to the State Championships in Cross Country, some of whom went on to compete in college at the NCAA Division I and II levels.</p>

              <div id="more" style="height: 0; overflow: hidden;"> 
              <p class="flow-text">After about 2 years at Lake Howell, Erica took on a new role as a Teacher and Coach. Still leading the Boys and Girls Cross Country teams and the Distance squad for Track, Erica has grown the program from 5 to 15+ on the distance team and has developed athletes from non-runners to State-caliber athletes.</p> 
              <p class="flow-text">Aside from school coaching, Erica coaches individual athletes one-on-one, developing customized training plans to meet her clients' needs. She coaches anyone - from those who want to lose weight to those who want to qualify for the Boston Marathon or run a personal record. Her training plans range from simply running to running, strength and nutrition.</p> 
              <p class="flow-text">As a Certified Personal Trainer through the International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA), Erica also trains and teaches group bootcamp classes at Orlando Fitbody Bootcamp, where she has been teaching for the past 5 years. The classes are 30-minute High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which improves athletic capacity and condition as well as improves glucose metabolism, essentially burning the most fat in a short amount of time. Erica loves the sport almost as much as she loves helping others get to the next level and achieve their goals.
